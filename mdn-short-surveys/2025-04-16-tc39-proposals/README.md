# TC39 proposals Short Survey

## Date

The survey ran between 2025-04-07 - 2025-04-15 and was shown to all users of MDN JavaScript pages.

## Questions

1. Please rank these proposals in order of preference for inclusion in JavaScript:
   
   _Respondents were asked to drag and drop the following proposals into a ranked list. Not all proposals had to be ranked and respondents could rank as few or as many proposals as they wanted._

   _Respondents were also presented with a link to [a document which described the proposals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DMPXS4Po5Nd-l0mIEYj78H1S_R5FrB7CkHbluhqQPVo/edit)._
   
   _The proposals were presented in a random order for each respondent._

   * Decorators
   * ESM phase imports
   * Deferred module evaluation
   * JSON.parse source text access
   * Source phase imports
   * Joint iteration
   * Iterator sequence

### Decorators

#### Reasons for picking Decorators

Here are the main categories that emerge from the free-form responses from people who ranked Decorators as their top choice:

| Parity with other languages and frameworks (Java, C#, PHP, Rust, Python, Dart, Nest.js, Django) | 32 |
| Parity with Typescript and/or Angular (waiting for the non-standard TS implementation to be standardized) | 24 |
| Useful for web components, custom elements, parity with Lit | 15 |
| Better performance, less dependencies, no need for a build step if implemented natively | 11 |
| Use case: Logging | 11 |
| Useful for libraries | 7 |
| Useful but not essential | 6 |
| Use case: Dependency injection | 6 |
| Use case: Memoization | 6 |
| Use case: Debugging | 4 |
| Use case: Input and data validation | 4 |
| Use case: ORM | 3 |
| Use case: Authentication, authorization, and other middlewares | 2 |
| Use case: Measure function execution time | 2 |
| Use case: Serialization | 2 |
| Use case: Function result caching | 1 |
| Use case: Testing | 1 |
| Use case: Clean-up after function execution (close files, database connections, etc.) | 1 |
